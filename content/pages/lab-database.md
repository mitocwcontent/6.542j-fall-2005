This page contains digitized media files for use in the labs. Most of the files are audio data, but there are also image files and other types of data. For some of the labs, you are asked to record your own voice. If you do not have the tools for making such recordings, example utterances are provided as spoken by both a female speaker and a male speaker. The audio files are given below under the heading of the relevant lab.

{{< anchor "lab1" >}}Lab 1: Recording Speech in a Sound-Treated Room, and Spectral Analysis and Waveform Editing by Computer{{< /anchor >}}
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In Lab 1, you will record a database of speech utterances for use throughout the semester. Below are links to sample databases recorded by two speakers, one female (HH) and one male (KS).

Note that although these files have a .wav suffix, they are in Klatt format, for use with the Klatt speech-analysis tools (xkl); they are **not** Microsoft® .wav format.

You can download zip archives of an entire database here:

4.  Rainbow Passage
    
    When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act like a prism and form a rainbow. The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. There is, according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. People look, but no one ever finds it. When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
    
5.  Spontaneous Speech
    
    Describe in detail the room in which you are sitting (hesitations, ah's, etc., are normal).
    
6.  Prosody Sentences
    
    List the following pairs of sentences:  
    Please say Bray CUP again.  
    Please say BRAY cup again.
    
    Please say lake EELS again.
