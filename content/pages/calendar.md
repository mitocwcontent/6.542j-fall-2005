The course met twice a week, with lectures lasting about one hour. There were also two lab sessions scheduled each week. The calendar below provides information on the course's lecture (L) and term project (P) sessions. The lab sessions covered similar topics, and lab reports were to be handed in on the next class day after the lab.
