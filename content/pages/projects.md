Short Term Project and Paper
----------------------------

Students select a topic at about the middle of the semester and propose a limited experiment. Oral reports on results are given during the last few class meetings. Written versions (in the format of the [Journal of the Acoustical Society of America](https://asa.scitation.org/journal/jas)) are to be submitted at the last class meeting.

Below are two lists of suggested term projects. Students may select a project from these lists, or may suggest a project of their own. (Although there are two lists, students are only required to choose **one** topic.)
